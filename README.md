ISTRUCTIONS TO RUN CODE
To run the code on a different machine would require one to:
1.Set up a new google drive to download to store images and files
2.Change the path of the google drive mount to specify the new google drive.
3.Set up the runtime to use T4GPU(navigate to “runtime” on google collab 2.click “change runtime type ” and select T4GPU) 
4.for registering your datasets in coco ,just reference the  images in the google drive as parameters as shown in the code first with the .JSON extension to get the annotations and then the directory path for those images if you are to use new images.
